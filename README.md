# Part 1 
Git/Github/Webstorm Tutorial: <br />The user will discover how to use an IDE to access GIT and Github in this tutorial. The user needs to download Webstorm and GIT for the first stage. The user will set up their own GitHub account at www.Github.com while these system software downloads are taking place. The user will then establish a repository on this site and clone it on their local computer. Once everything has been downloaded and set up, the user should be ready to push, pull, and do much more with their content between their IDE and Github. It is crucial for the user to link their GitHub account to their preferred IDE.

# Part 2: Definitions
<br />GIT: a program that maintains a version history of modifications to files and coding
<br />Merge Conflict: a situation in which a merging does not occur and GIT wants the user's input on what should be included in the final merge.
<br />Fetch: a command that downloads the user's most recent updated data from the remote repository into a local repository (without merging)
<br />Remote: a location where numerous users can contribute to, edit, and view each other's modifications
<br />Branch: a command that enables programmers to extract code from the original code so they can alter it on their own and perhaps even combine it with other stuff
<br />Clone: a command to download the user's repository in its entirety
<br />Commit: a command that saves file changes while GIT logs each time when and by whom it was last modified by
<br />Push: a procedure that uploads files from a local storage location to a distant repository
<br />GITHUB: a business that uses GIT to create online repositories that make it simpler for programmers to save, edit, and share their coding
Repository: The primary "folder" place where multiple people can save their data and coding files
<br />Pull: a command that downloads data from the remote repository into the local repository instead of pushing data there like the "push" command does
<br />Merge: a command that unifies multiple branches into a single branch
